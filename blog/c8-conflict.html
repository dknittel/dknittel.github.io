      A time when I had a conflict was when I was working on a group project for an operations course in college. There were four other members in our group and one of them rarely showed up to our meetings and when he did he would be late and not contribute at all. I felt a few emotions including anger and frustration towards this person and the situation.

      The first thing I did to try to resolve the conflict was to talk to him about it and try to show him why his actions were unfair to the rest of us by putting him in our shoes. He promised that he would contribute more and even showed up to the next few meetings. However, I spent most of the meetings working on homework for other courses and so I began to feel frustrated with him again, especially because our project deadline was approaching and we were behind schedule.

     Finally I emailed my other group members about him and they expressed similar frustrations so we spoke with our professor about it and he promised that the lack of participation of our teammate would not impact our grade.   
    </p>

      If I could go back, I would have talked to my teammate and have everyone in the group talk to him because that would have been much more influential and likely would have gotten him to contribute more. From this experience I learned that in work and life in general you will occasionally get bad team members so it is important to be prepared for it and address it early. I also learned to not let these situations get to me and to try to make the best out of every situation.
