    <h4>Pairing</h4>
    <p>
      I really enjoy pairing because coding can occasionally get tedious and frustrating when I work on my own. When I have a partner however, we are able to bounce ideas off of each other and build off these ideas, which makes pseudocoding quicker yet more descriptive and useful. Additionally, often times when the driver gets stuck, the navigator knows exactly how to resolve the issue. They can also point out errors in the driver's code as the driver types so that the driver does not have to go back and spend hours debugging to find the one small error. Even if the navigator does not know what to do when the driver gets stuck, having two people researching the problem makes resolving the issue go twice as fast. It can also be very helpful when your partner teaches you a new trick or method that you didn't know before that will help you in the future. On the other side, teaching someone else one of these tricks can be a very rewarding experience, while also solidifying your own understanding.

    <h4>Feedback</h4>
    <p>
      I felt good when I read my feedback on Socrates. The feedback was helpful to my learning but I wish there had been a little more constructive criticism so that I know what to work on. The main piece feedback that I receieved was to be a little more vocal when I have something to say so I will be sure to work on this when pairing from here on out. I enjoyed writing feedback because I felt like I was helping others improve while also providing them encouragement and praise for their strengths. The most difficult part of writing feedback is giving criticisms because I try to be very careful to not hurt their feelings and sometimes it's hard to find anything to critique for my partners.

      Overall, I've found pairing to be a great educational experience because partners teach each other knew things in nearly every session. Feedback has also been helpful but not quite to the same extent. I believe this could be improved if people gave each other a little more constructive criticism.
