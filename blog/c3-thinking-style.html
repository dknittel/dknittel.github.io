    <h4>My Thinking Style</h4>
    <p>
      My thinking style is concrete sequential. Concrete sequential thinkers prefer structure and logical sequences and do not like working in groups or trying to be creative. Most of the concrete sequential description fits me. For example, it is true that I prefer logical sequences and do not always like being creative.  However, there are times where I prefer to work in groups because when one person gets stuck the other person often knows how to resolve the problem and vice versa. I can take advantage of this thinking style by being very organized and always laying out a structure for how I am going to attack a problem. A good example of how to do this is pseudocoding in great detail, which will give me a better structure for when I start coding. I could also try to push myself to be more creative in order to improve this area of weakness for me.

    <h4>Reflecting on Learning</h4>
    <p>
      The biggest struggle for me so far at DBC was installing Linux on to my computer and getting comfortable with the command line. This is not very related to my thinking style and more to the fact that I can get frustrated easily. I could use my thinking style to help avoid frustration by planning more so that I do not procrastinate and have to do everything at the last minute.  
    </p>
    <h4>Growth vs Fixed Mindset</h4>
    <p>
      It is important for me to have a growth mindset regarding my thinking style so that I know that I can always improve my weaknesses. I could do this by stepping outside my comfort zone and working in groups more often and attempting to be creative. By focusing on improving my weaknesses, I will become a more well-rounded individual which can be attractive to employers and just make things in life easier.
