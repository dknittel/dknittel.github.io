      Using version control is beneficial because it allows the user to share their work with other people and allows multiple people to work on the same file at the same time. Each person can work on one individual part of the code at the same time rather than having one person work on something at a time and then have to send it to the other group members. It is also useful because it allows the users to revert back to an older version if someone messes up the code and they cannot figure out what is wrong with it.

        Git helps you keep track of changes by making a note of every time you change the state of a file. It also allows you to return to the most recent commit. This is similar to a save point in a video game because if you die or turn off the console, you can always simply return to that save point.

        It is helpful to use GitHub to store code because it allows you to save your work on the internet. Therefore, you can access your file from any computer. Additionally, anyone else on your team can access that file and make changes even while you are making changes.
