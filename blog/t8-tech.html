      According to the ruby on rails website, "Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language." It assumes certain things avout what a programmer needs to get started in order to make it easier to program web applications. In doing so, Rails permits programmers have more functionality than other languages and frameworks even while writing less code. In order to maximize the utility of rails, you must learn "The Rails Way". If you instead use habits from other languages, Rails can be much more frustrating. The primary guiding principles are to keep code DRY by not repeating yourself and to use convention over configuartion becaues Rails has a default way of doing things.

       Rails is a model-view-controller framework and it provides the default structures for web-services, a web page, and a database. A model in model-view-controller corresponds both to a Ruby file and to a databse. A controller reacts to external requests by choosing which view file to render and it is a client-side component of Rails. A view is an erb file, which is evaluated and then changed to HTML when it runs. There are several different packages for Ruby on Rails including Action Pack, Action Mailer, Active Support, ActiveRecord and Active Resource and programmers can also create plugins to expand these packages.
