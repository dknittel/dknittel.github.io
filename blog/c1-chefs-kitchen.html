    After watching the video, I am even more excited about DBC because it uses the kitchen mindset, which is very appealing to me. I like the idea of people working together as one to help each other learn rather than having everyone just looking out for themsleves. My impression of DBC is that it is very collaborative and that everyone is willing to help everyone else which is very cool! I see myself fitting in very well with this type of culture because I have always enjoyed helping others since it is a very rewarding experience. In addition, teaching others helps me learn the material better. My expectations of DBC have changed for the better slightly, however I had already heard that DBC had a pretty collaborative and welcoming environment, which is awesome! I am very excited about living in this type of environment. I will be able to ask for assistance whenever I get stuck because there will always be someone who got stuck in the same spot and had learned to solve it. I think I will feel very comfortable asking for help from others and giving help so I am not nervous about this at all.
