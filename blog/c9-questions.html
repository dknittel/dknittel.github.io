      A time when I asked a question that was not so good was when I asked a friend for career advice about computer science. My question was very brief and vague because I just said something like: "From your experiences, what advice can you give me about starting a career in computer science." He still did his best to help me but it would have helped him help me if I had framed my question in a more specific manner. One way that I could have done this was by doing more research beforehand so that I knew more about computer science and could therefore ask better questions. In addition, preparing questions beforehand would have made our conversation more useful for me. I asked the question via email so I probably should have proofread it before sending it because spelling and grammar are important for making a good first impression. One thing I did do a good job of was being concise which is important espcially when talking to busy people because you don't want to waste their time.

      Another time that I could have asked a better question was when I posted a question asking for help with coding. I did not include any pictures of my code so people could not see first-hand what the issue was. This made it much more difficult for them to help me resolve the issue. One thing that I did well was I responded to the people who helped me immediately so that I wouldn't have to wait a long time to hear their next response. I also tried to be very polite and thanked people for their help to show my appreciation while indicating that I would be happy to do the same for them. Overall, when asking questions I think the most important thing is preparing beforehand by doing research and thinking through your question carefully and it can also help to include pictures of your code.
