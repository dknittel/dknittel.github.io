    <h4>Object-Oriented Programming</h4>
    <p>
      Object-oriented programming is centered around the idea of "objects" which are data structures that contain data and behavior. Object-oriented languages can create computer programs using objects that interact with each other and most languages are class-based. Some exapmles of OO programming languages are Ruby, Java, C++, Python, and PHP. It's useful to use object-oriented languages when the number of operations on things is not changing and as you change your code, you mostly just add new things. This is because if you add a new operation, you will likely have to change a number of classes in order to add a method. Object-oriented programming suggests that the objects that we update are more significant than the logic that we use to change them.

    <h4>Functional Programming</h4>
    <p>
      In functional programming, on the other hand, programming is done with expressions and the output of a function only depends on what is put into it. Functional programming originated from lamda calculus and these languages are used more in educational settings than in software development. Some examples of functional programming languages are Hope, Rex, Common Lisp, and Scheme. It seems that functional programming languages are much less common than OO languages because I have not heard of any of these languages but have heard of most of the OO languages. It's better to use functional languages when the set of objects is unchanging and as you update your code, you mostly add new operations on existing objects. This is because if you add a new thing you might have to change a large number of function definitions if you want to add a case.
