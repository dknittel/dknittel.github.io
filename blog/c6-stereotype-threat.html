      Stereotype threat is when a person is at the risk of proving that a negative stereotype about their group is true. When that person's race is emphasized before their performance of that task, they are much more likely to fall into the stereotype than if it is not emphasized. For example, it is a negative stereotype that asian people are bad drivers and if someone told an asian person that asians are bad drivers right before the asian person drove, it is more likely that they will not drive well.

      I don't think I've exactly been affected by stereotype threat but I have faced discrimination for being Jewish. I'm not very religious at all but since my mom is Jewish, people in high school would always pick on me for being Jewish. For example, every time I refused to buy something, people would say it was because I was a stingy Jew. I think over the years I have become more frugal and I wonder if this is an example of stereotype threat where people are pointing out the stereotype of Jews being stingy and that made me more likely to want to save money. Sometimes I try to be extra careful to not seem stingy by doing things like overpaying for tips or not being concerned when someone owes me money. This can be pretty annoying because there have been times where someone did not pay me the money they owed me at all and it has probably caused me to spend money on things I don't need.

      I can see how stereotype threat can be very harmful to people and I'm sure that some people have experienced much more severe instances of it. Therefore, it is crucial that we continue to educate people on being more sensitive to people's cultures and religions. This will go a long way towards helping people live together more peacefully, even reducing the risk of wars, and ultimately making the world a better place.
