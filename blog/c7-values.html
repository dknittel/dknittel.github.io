      When I think about the best moments of my life, a number of values come to mind. Friendship is probably the most significant out of all of them beacuse some of my best memories are just hanging out with my friends. In trying to live up to this value, I would give myself a 4 out of 5 because I usually hang out with friends when they are around but sometimes I do not do a great job of keeping in touch with friends when we're not together. Accomplishment is another very important value to me because I am very proud of the accomplishments I have made in my life and they have created good memories for me, as well. I would give myself a 5 out of 5 in trying to live up to this value because I am a very hard-working and determined individual and so I like to think that I have accomplished a lot in my life. Competition is another very important value to me because I am a very competitive person which is why I love to play sports, poker, video games, and pretty much anything else that you can compete at. I would give myself a 5 in trying to live up to this value because I jump at every opportunity to be competitive and I always have a lot of fun doing it.

      The last thing that someone asked me for advice on was how to stay motivated in their college work. I think this relates to the value of accomplishment because having goals and looking forward to an accomplishment can be a good source of motivation when doing work. I told my friend that whenever they are feeling stuck or unmotivated, they should always think back to their goals and they will feel a renewed sense of motivation. Competiveness can also help with this issue because competing with other people can serve as a great source of motivation. Additionally, I have heard that the best person to compete with is yourself and so you should strive to improve yourself every day.

      I think that the value of friendship will be able to help me deal with stereotype threat because having a lot of friends supporting you can make dealing with difficult obstacles much easier. Good friends always know what to say when you are having difficulty with something which is why it is very important to have a supportive friend network no matter what you are doing. When I am feeling down at DBC I can always think back to my goals like I told my friend and look forward to the sense of accomplishment I will feel when I finish DBC. In addition, my competitiveness will help me strive to improve myself by becoming a better coder.
