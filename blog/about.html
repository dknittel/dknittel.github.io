<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Daniel Knittel. I am from Palo Alto, CA and I am currently a coding student at Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco. I just graduated from the University of Michigan with an undergraduate degree in Business Administration where I focused on sales and marketing. Last summer I worked for an advisory company called CEB in D.C. where I was selling their advisory services to executives in large enterprise banks around the country.

During my senior year in college, I discovered a passion for coding when my friends and family members introduced it to me. I soon began learning coding online as well as through an introduction to computer science course. I enjoyed it so much that I decided to pursue a career in computer science. Rather than staying in college for two extra years, I determined that attending Dev Bootcamp this summer would be the best way to jumpstart my career in computer science.

I am a very hardworking and driven individual and am very quantitative so I enjoy working with numbers and solving complex problems. These interests and skills, coupled with my desire to work in silicon valley where I have spent most of my life, make compuer science the perfect profession for me.</p>
