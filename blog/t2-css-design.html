    <h4>Relative</h4>
    <p>
      When you set an elements positioning to relative, it is being positioned relative to itself. Without any other positioning attributes, relative positioning is no different than static positioning. However, when you do add positioning attributes such as left: 20px, the object will move 20 pixels to the right from where it would be if it were static. This can be useful when you are having trouble lining up elements correctly. Setting a product to relative also makes it appear on top of static elements.
    <h4>Absolute</h4>
    </p>
      Absolute positioning lets you place an object anywhere you want to put it with the top, left, right, and bottom commands. If the element's parent element has relative positioning, then child element's position will be relative to the parent. Elements that have absoloute positioning are taken out of the flow of the other object that are on the page. Absolute positioned elements do not influence the position of other elements and other elements do not influence its position either. Therefore, having too many absolute positioned elements can make a webpage less flexible.
    <h4>Fixed</h4>
    <p>
      The position of fixed elements is relative to the browser window or the viewport. Therefore, when the page is scrolled, a fixed element will not move. One benefit of fixed positioning is it can make it so that the navigation is always on the page. However, one limitation is that it can negatively impact usability by doing things like cutting off content.
